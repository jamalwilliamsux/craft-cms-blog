          <h1>Bhairava</h1>
          <p>
            Bhairava counts most destructive and deadly manifestation of the god Shiva, born from His wrath.
            According to the myth, Shiva created Bhairava from himself, from
            his third eye, in order to punish Brahma, the god who created the
            material universe. In the entire Indo-Aryan pantheon, numbering
            thousands of deities, it is difficult to find a figure more formidable
            and intimidating. No one and nothing can resist the destructive
            power of Bhairava. After his blow with a monstrous club-khatvanga
            - not only dust, but even emptiness dies and ceases
            exist. Great Gods such as Brahma and Vishnu fear the wrath of
            Bhairava. Even Yama - the god of death, the underworld and the
            dead can be destroyed by Bhairava - "Death of death of death."
            Mystics, anarchs, warriors and adepts, whose deifying practice
            includes crime through the laws of samsaric society, revere
            Bhairava as a liberator who destroys all fetters and obstacles to the
            attainment of Divinity, both internal and external. At the same
            time, such an understanding of Bhairava is one-sided and
            incomplete. Bhairava is not only the total destroyer, but also the
            one who transforms sin into holiness, impurity into purity, duality
            into non-duality. Bhairava is the Lord of tantric yoga, shamanic
            rituals, magic and sorcery. De facto he is the founder God

            mystical anarcho insurrectionism
            mystical traditional
            insurrectionism, as well as the Father and Patron of the so-called
            "underworld". Bhairava teaches his children how to use crime in
            spiritual practice through the norms and laws of a wide society. So
            that this practice does not lead to the accumulation of bad karma,
            but leads to spiritual self-improvement. Among other things,
            Bhairava is the embodiment of horror and fear on the part of the
            profane. It is said that those who want to worship Him, to become
            adepts of Bhairava-Kali-Dharma, must investigate and recognize
            the source of all their fears. His name comes from the root "Bhi"
            meaning "fear". Bhairava means "terrible, eerie, terrifying". His
            wakhanas are wolf, dog, bear, lion, tiger and octopus. Of these, the
            wolf and the dog are the most frequently mentioned in sacred
            texts. They are most often present on the images of Bhairava and
            next to His statues.
