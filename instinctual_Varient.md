Descriptions of sx/sp and sp/sx

Found these descriptions online. Probably the most accurate description I've read so far about sx/sp
sp/sx Motivation: to explore new ways to maintain a secure and comfortable living. Appearance: self-absorbed, wistful, calm, withdrawn, internally intense.
This type has a quiet, down-to-earth but mysterious quality. They are intense within but may seem withdrawn to others. They naturally seek intimacy but not at the expense of their independence or emotional security. This may create a pull-push effect, in which they draw others in but detach if they feel like they may get hurt. For the few interpersonal bonds they form, their loyalty is unbreakable, but these alliances make them feel more secure. They attach to others at an organic level, as opposed to the sp/so's formality. They are often unaware of the social dynamics and goals of a group, but they can read an individual with accuracy. When they sense their well-being is in jeopardy, they either completely withdraw or confront the danger head-on. Some have an appetite for wild adventures, which they view as learning experiences. They see their home as a refuge, and they take pride in decorating their surroundings.
Compatible with: sx/sp, sp/sx, sp/so

sx/sp Motivation: to reconcile inner conflict, explore the mind and soul, and discover truths in a comfortable, independent environment. Appearance: internally intense, brooding, contained energy, self-absorbed.

They are on an eternal search for the missing piece. They live according to their own outlook and are only affected by the affirmation of a select few. Their ambitions are more personal in nature and do not necessarily have a social cause. They may isolate themselves for extended periods when feeling anxious or depressed, seeking understanding from within. They focus their repressed sexual energy into understanding their subconscious emotions and behaviors. They are often restless, torn between a stable life and the urge to explore. Some are prone to self-medication. Many have a naturally seductive, sexual charisma that may manifest as erotic playfulness or an untouchable aura to other sx types. They can create an unsurpassed level of intimacy with their partners. When they find a soulmate, they will bond without expressing the formalities of their connection. Once they feel deeply connect, they have difficulty letting go. When stressed, their sexual tension may carry out as erractic, impulsively self-destructive behaviors.

A guide: Sp/so vs sp/sx (so-blind or sx-blind)
I notice a lot of people have issues with choosing whether they are so-blind or sx-blind and I thought I’d help. Generally, first up, when people ask this question 90% of the time they are sx-blind sp/so.
Your first instinct is your biggest focus and source of fear (for example a So-first might actually feel they're bad at socialising but be upset about it and want to improve) whereas your second instinct supports your first and is kind of like an experimental playground. Your blindspot is the instinct you just don't care about that much, you kind of ignore it or don't think it matters.

Sp/So (SX-blind) people tend to:
* Use their SO second to support their SP first, their primary goal is to secure/protect themselves on their little comfortable metaphorical island by hoarding resources and subconsciously they see people as a resource e.g. want people to like them otherwise fear they will be without support or be left out. They adjust their SP ‘me vs the world’ viewpoint to SP/SO ‘me (and my select groups like family and friends) vs the world.’
* Have a grounded and relaxed but spread energy, tend to be people who like chill vibes when ‘hanging’ out with people.
* Want to feel included, connected, to build relationships through communication and closeness, to get to know others, and to contribute in some way to society.
* Be focused on reputation and status which is particularly very important to them.
* Feel not enough, instead of too much.
* Be steady, organized, and practical. They can prioritize time well and pride themselves on, for instance, finding a bargain or putting forth their best effort.
* Prefer to blend in instead of stand out, don’t like attention or spotlight on them.
* Be more aware of what is considered appropriate within their culture and able to pay attention to the social cues around them.
* Find intense conversations and eye contact with people trying to peer into their soul and solve them like a rubiks cube uncomfortable and awkward.
* Not constantly obsess and romanticise over crushes and trying to find their soul mate.
* Sexual activities might feel less sacred, like just enjoy a fun time with someone you like.
* Fear overly personal or intimate experiences, fear being fully open and vulnerable with someone.
* Be quite adaptable and flexible as well as accepting of others, sharing in things with others.
* Bond with people over same interests/similarities, that makes them feel relatable and part of a community like they fit in and people get them.

Sp/Sx (So-blind) people tend to:
* Use their SX second to support their SP first, their primary goal is to secure/protect themselves on their little comfortable metaphorical island by hoarding resources and subconsciously they romanticise a profound and intense connection with another person who can share the burden and will understand them the way no one else can whilst providing them with a inspirational high. They adjust their SP ‘me vs the world’ viewpoint to SP/SX ‘me (and my soulmate) vs the world.’
* Be very intense and focused, directing their full attention onto a person or a task at hand in explosive bursts.
* Have mysterious and exotic vibes, seemingly private but weirdly very open with a kind of electric flirty challenging or moody broody energy.
* They often have an inner confidence and knowledge about themselves, knowing who they are and what they want – not caring what others think about them and will refuse to adapt or change themselves for others.
* Don't really care for social inclusion/approval/contribution or group harmony, in fact often feel uncomfortable/awkward/not themselves in a group.
* Dislike small talk or communication for the sake of communication (including 'just hanging out') for things need to have purpose and meaning – their time/attention is very precious to them.
* Be unaware of social cues and group dynamics, prefer being alone or one-on-one meaningful interactions.
* Be stubborn and determined, often stormy and explosive – they don't mind conflict and differences between people.
* Like to rebel, like darker topics, and underbelly of society.
* Be oblivious to the world around them and stuck in their heads - often in fantasy land.
* Seek intimacy and vulnerability with like-minded individuals, wanting to fully open up pouring their soul into someone in order to connect on a deeper level.
* Dislike social pressure and expectation, sets their own personal goals and expectations instead.
* Focus on their own needs before others, can be seen as selfish or self-indulgent.
* Love ‘the chase’ feeling of excitement and looking to be engaged/stimulated in some way – like getting a charge from being plugged into an electrical socket.
* Be very possessive, wants to possess and be possessed - wants to claim things and be claimed.
* Feel too much, instead of not enough.

Sexual instinct is about passion, fusion, intensity, attraction, chemistry, being desirable, provoking reaction or feelings, finding what or who sensually fits.
Social instinct is about social relationships, connection, care, social role, social responses, placements within social system and knowing how to act to maintain it or change it (sounds like some corporate shit but believe me, it's as easy as knowing how to behave as a student with a teacher, as a friend with your friend, as a bully leader with other bullies, as a person who know how to start a revolution or affect people's opinions on social structures, or as a person who is stone-set on their view of how society should be). And, it's not the attitude that matters, it's how CONSCIOUS of these structures you are. You can have So in your stack and be an asshole.
It's absolutely possible to approach group bonding from a Sexual perspective. You can go to a group of people to get boiled in a soup of human emotions and reactions, get attracted and show that you're attractive.
Or, you can build a one-on-one relationship on principles that reflect Social bonding tools: trust, mutual understanding, acceptance, honesty, aim to make a connection as long-term as possible, respect, doing some social rituals, equality, and so on.


The ivs stay the same for the entire tritype. If I am 317 so/sx 3w2 is so/sx 1 is so/sx and 7 is so/sx.
Sp is about survival of the fittest. And a need to contend with surviving in the situations of life. You want to guarantee your safety and security type of thing.
So is about group concerns and leadership and thinking of the group not so much about bonding. Group dynamics, and caring for the group. Being in society, stuff of that nature.
Sx is intimacy, merging with others and attracting love in certain regards. Wil
