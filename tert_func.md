Tert Functions

It brings balance.
Your first function is what drives you, and determines behavior. Your second is what you do with the information from the first function. Your third tries to bring harmony to both earlier functions and keep both from being too extreme.
Extreme behavior is when the third (and fourth) functions are not working properly – that’s when you see COMPLETELY irrational or COMPLETELY logical behavior, or COMPLETELY withdrawn from reality or COMPLETELY living in the moment characters. This is why there are such big differences between the extroverts and introverts of the same basic type – why ESTPs have less of a tendency to think about the long term consequences of their actions than ISTPs, who struggle more with forming emotional connections.
If you only ever used Fe without Ti, you would have no logic. None. No logical stability, no ability to problem-solve. Same with Fi and Te. If you only used Si without Ne, you would never want to change, or see beyond the obvious. If you never used Se with Ni, you would never escape your dreams or take measures in reality to make them real.Etc.
If your first function is what defines you, and your second is something you are skilled with, your third tries to balance them both out. It pulls at the second function and tries to shift its focus, so that it is not JUST … thinking… or feeling… or perception… or external interaction with the world. It tries to shift the second function and support it, but it is not strong enough to dominate it. Just to tug on it. To say, “Try change,” or “Is that logical?” or “Do something about it,” or “act now!”
And then, of course, your fourth harasses you, gives you anxiety in that area, and pulls in a strong direction away from your dominant … but it’s usually so dominated by the other three functions that it simply… struggles.


If you’re an extrovert, the secret of defining/discerning your type does not lie in your inferior function, which you may not recognize in yourself because it’s subjective and pointing inward, but in your external functions.
Which two extroverted functions are showing most of the time? What’s your tert-function (third)? That’s how you find your type as an extrovert.
Extroverted Sensing (Se): delight in sensory environment, new experiences, often takes joy in physical exercise, pushing their body to its limit, or staying in shape. Tends to go for ‘the best life has to offer’ (wine, expensive clothing, apartments, food, sex). Impulsive, sometimes reckless. Uses (dom) or can develop (tert) the ability to pay close attention to the sensory environment / notice little things. (ENXJ / ESXP)
Extroverted Intuition (Ne): enjoyment of brainstorming ideas with others, often sees multiple possibilities, openness toward changing their mind on ideas, belief systems, or political stances that are not ingrained, somewhat of a “do what you want” attitude, general restlessness, yearning for intellectual things. May have a dozen hobbies or interests, which they keep for a certain amount of time or abandon in boredom in pursuit of something else. This is their life (dom) or this is how they play (tert). (ESXJ / ENXP)
Extroverted Thinking (Te): a tendency to “take charge” and insist on “making things happen,” with the ability to buckle down and finish projects, make lists, plan out schedules, or take action oriented toward financial or other success. Can condense information in a format easily understood and followed by other people, using examples, spreadsheets, or charts if necessary. Sometimes (tert) or always (dom) enjoys organization and the process of planning; might talk aloud or “see their words in the air” in front of them. (EXFP / EXTJ)
Extroverted Feeling (Fe): general charm and awareness of the emotional environment, with an interest in and tendency to act as a stabilizing force, often with a tendency to mirror or engage other people’s emotions to get them to like you, to accomplish something. Good at smoothing things over, knowing what to say to diffuse tension (dom), or anxiety at the thought of dealing with purely emotional conversations (tert). Can become offended, and may pull other people or external examples (”Well, YOU SAID…”) into the argument as a defense. (EXTP / EXFJ)


I think I’ve talked about this before.
Tert functions bring balance to whatever is in front of it. If it’s two perceiving functions in a row, the tert function balances out the aux, so that you are always perceiving reality in some form. Same with judging functions.
Think about it. Without tert, where would you be? Where would I be?
Aux Te needs Fi. Otherwise Te would say, “Do this,” and not ask, “Is it moral?”
Aux Fi needs Te. Otherwise Fi would say, “I feel this,” and not say, “Do something about it.”
Aux Fe needs Ti. Otherwise Fe would say, “I’m upset,” and not ask, “WHY?”
Aux Ti needs Fe. Otherwise Ti would say, “This is logic,” and not ask, “Will it offend other people?”
Aux Se needs Ni. Otherwise Se says, “Live in the moment,” and not, “But think about tomorrow, too.”
Aux Ni needs Se. Otherwise Ni says, “I dream constantly of tomorrow,” and not, “I can live in the now too.”
Aux Si needs Ne. Otherwise Si says, “This is all I’ve ever known,” and not, “But what about the greater possibilities?”
Aux Ne needs Si. Otherwise Ne says, “There are so many possibilities to explore,” and not, “But which ones have proven trustworthy in the past?”
Tert is important, because it balances out two of your functions. You don’t have that balance with your dominant and inferior function, which is why one of them is so much out of control whenever it kicks on. The downside? Is there one? Well, if working right, it may stop you from doing stupid things. Some might consider that downside.
